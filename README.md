# Seattle Heating Oil Analysis
### A simple data analysis exercise to estimate the number and geographic distribution of single family homes using heating oil

In this analysis, I use publically available data from the King County Assessors office to estimate the number of single family homes in Seattle, the number of homes that use oil heat, and how that has changed in the recent past.

Data can be found at https://info.kingcounty.gov/assessor/DataDownload/default.aspx

King County maintains separate files for [residential buildings](https://aqua.kingcounty.gov/extranet/assessor/Residential%20Building.zip), [condos](https://aqua.kingcounty.gov/extranet/assessor/Condo%20Complex%20and%20Units.zip), [apartments](https://aqua.kingcounty.gov/extranet/assessor/Apartment%20Complex.zip), and [accessory dwellings](https://aqua.kingcounty.gov/extranet/assessor/Accessory.zip).
